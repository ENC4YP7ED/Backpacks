## Features

### Core Features
- **Wearable Storage**: Backpacks can be worn in the chest armor slot or placed as decorative blocks
- **27 Inventory Slots**: Same capacity as a shulker box for balanced gameplay
- **Dyeable**: Customize your backpack with any dye color, just like leather armor
- **Interactive Access**: Access other players' or entities' backpacks by approaching from behind
- **Real-Time Multiplayer Sync**: Multiple players can access the same backpack simultaneously with live inventory updates - no duplication possible
- **Visual Animations**: Smooth opening and closing animations with custom sound effects
- **Safety Features**: Cannot remove a backpack while it contains items (prevents accidental item loss)
- **Dual-Mode Item**: Functions as both wearable equipment and a placeable block

### Crafting
- **8 Leather** in a hollow square pattern (unless Farmer's Delight is installed, which adds a rope alternative)

## Accessories Mod Integration

**NEW!** This fork adds full integration with the [Accessories mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/accessories):

### What's New

#### Dedicated Backpack Slot
- When Accessories is installed, backpacks can be equipped in a dedicated **"back" accessories slot**
- No longer occupies your chest armor slot - wear your chestplate and backpack simultaneously!
- Works seamlessly with or without Accessories installed

#### Keybinding Support
- **Press 'B'** (configurable) to quickly open your backpack inventory
- Only active when Accessories mod is installed
- Customizable in Controls â†’ "Backpack for Dummies" category
- Works whether backpack is in chest slot or accessories slot

#### Smart Placement & Pickup
- **Place blocks from accessories slot**: Shift+right-click to place backpack as a block, even when equipped in accessories
- **Smart pickup prioritization**: Picking up backpacks automatically goes to accessories slot first, then chest slot
- **Seamless slot switching**: Works intelligently whether Accessories is installed or not

#### Rendering Behavior
- **Invisible in Accessories Slot**: When equipped in the accessories slot, the backpack is **not rendered** on the player's back
- **Reason**: The backpack uses its own custom model/rendering system from the chest armor slot. Accessories mod's item rendering is disabled to avoid conflicts and unnecessary visual duplication
- **Chest Slot**: Full visual rendering with opening/closing animations when equipped in chest slot

#### Full Feature Compatibility
All original features work in both slots:
- âœ… Opening/closing animations (chest slot only)
- âœ… Behind-the-back access from other players
- âœ… Dyeable colors
- âœ… Safety lock (can't remove non-empty backpacks)
- âœ… Sound effects
- âœ… Block placement from either slot
- âœ… Automatic return to preferred slot on pickup

### Optional Integration
The Accessories integration is **completely optional**:
- Works perfectly fine without Accessories installed (uses chest armor slot)
- Automatically detects and enables features when Accessories is present
- No crashes or errors when Accessories is missing

## Addon Development API

Backpack for Dummies provides a comprehensive API for creating addon mods that add custom backpack types. The API handles all the complex logic, allowing you to focus on your unique features.

### Quick Start

Create a custom backpack addon in just a few steps:

1. **Add dependency to your build.gradle**:
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation files('../Backpacks-master/build/libs/backpacks-0.3.2.jar')

    // Optional: Accessories API
    compileOnly "io.wispforest:accessories-neoforge:1.1.0-beta.39+1.21.1"
    localRuntime "io.wispforest:accessories-neoforge:1.1.0-beta.39+1.21.1"
}
```

2. **Extend base classes**:

```java
// Item
public class MyBackpackItem extends BaseBackpackItem {
    public MyBackpackItem(Block block, Properties properties) {
        super(block, properties);
    }
}

// Block
public class MyBackpackBlock extends BaseBackpackBlock {
    @Override
    protected BlockEntityType<?> getBlockEntityType() {
        return MyBlockEntities.MY_BACKPACK.get();
    }

    @Override
    public BlockEntity newBlockEntity(BlockPos pos, BlockState state) {
        return new MyBackpackBlockEntity(pos, state);
    }
}

// Block Entity
public class MyBackpackBlockEntity extends BaseBackpackBlockEntity {
    public MyBackpackBlockEntity(BlockPos pos, BlockState state) {
        super(MyBlockEntities.MY_BACKPACK.get(), pos, state);
    }

    @Override
    protected SoundEvent getOpenSound() {
        return SoundEvents.CHEST_OPEN;
    }

    @Override
    protected SoundEvent getCloseSound() {
        return SoundEvents.CHEST_CLOSE;
    }
}
```

### Features

#### âœ… Dual-Equip Prevention (Hardcoded)
The API automatically prevents equipping a backpack in chest slot when already wearing one in accessories (and vice versa). This is **hardcoded** and works for all backpack types.

```java
// In your BackpackAccessory class:
public class MyBackpackAccessory extends BaseBackpackAccessory {
    @Override
    protected Item getBackpackItem() {
        return MyItems.MY_BACKPACK.get();
    }
    // Dual-equip prevention is automatic!
}
```

#### âœ… Graceful Accessories API Degradation
All API methods gracefully handle when Accessories mod is not installed:
- Helper methods return `null` or `false`
- No crashes or errors
- Your addon works with OR without Accessories

```java
// This works whether Accessories is installed or not:
ItemStack backpack = BackpackEventHelper.getBackpackFromEntity(player, MyItems.MY_BACKPACK.get());
if (backpack != null) {
    // Handle backpack (works in chest OR accessories slot)
}
```

#### âœ… Custom Keybindings
Register your own keybinding that appears under "Backpack for Dummies" category:

```java
// Client-side only!
@OnlyIn(Dist.CLIENT)
public class MyBackpackKeybindings {
    public static KeyMapping OPEN_MY_BACKPACK;

    public static void register() {
        OPEN_MY_BACKPACK = BackpackKeybindingRegistry.registerKeybinding(
            "key.mymod.open_my_backpack",  // Translation key
            GLFW.GLFW_KEY_B,                // Default key (B)
            "My Custom Backpack"            // Display name
        );
    }
}

// In your mod constructor (client-side):
if (FMLEnvironment.dist == Dist.CLIENT) {
    MyBackpackKeybindings.register();
}
```

### Example: Ender Backpack Addon

See the complete example at: https://github.com/ENC4YP7ED/EnderBackpacks-addon

Key features demonstrated:
- Extends `BaseBackpackItem`, `BaseBackpackBlock`, `BaseBackpackBlockEntity`
- Custom ender chest synchronization (override `shouldStoreItems()`)
- Accessories integration using `BaseBackpackAccessory`
- Custom keybinding registration
- **171 lines of code saved** by using the API (76% reduction in block entity!)

### Code Reduction Example

**Before API** (161 lines):
```java
public class EnderBackpackBlockEntity extends BlockEntity {
    // Manual animation handling
    // Manual NBT serialization
    // Manual client-server sync
    // Manual sound effects
    // ... 161 lines of boilerplate
}
```

**After API** (39 lines):
```java
public class EnderBackpackBlockEntity extends BaseBackpackBlockEntity {
    public EnderBackpackBlockEntity(BlockPos pos, BlockState state) {
        super(EBBlockEntities.ENDER_BACKPACK.get(), pos, state);
    }

    @Override
    protected boolean shouldStoreItems() { return false; }

    @Override
    protected SoundEvent getOpenSound() { return BPSounds.BACKPACK_OPEN.value(); }

    @Override
    protected SoundEvent getCloseSound() { return BPSounds.BACKPACK_CLOSE.value(); }
}
```

**76% reduction** - everything else is handled by the API!

### Best Practices

1. **Always check for null** when using helper methods
2. **Use graceful degradation** - don't check `isAccessoriesLoaded()` manually
3. **Override only what you need** - base classes handle the rest
4. **Register keybindings client-side only** - use `@OnlyIn(Dist.CLIENT)`
5. **Test with and without Accessories** to ensure compatibility
